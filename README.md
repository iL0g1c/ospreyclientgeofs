###Speed Hacks
These currently only work in GeoFS 2.9. This hack works by increasing your aircrafts max RPMs.
The default is 100%, but you can modify your RPMs anywhere from 0 to 100 percent.
You can do this by dragging the slider, or typing in a percentage into the text box.
This hack is FRP seeing that modifing your planes stats is FRP.

###Flight Ceiling
To prevent aircraft from flying to space Xavier added a ZeroThrustAltitude. Once you reach this altitude, you will not be able to produce any thrust.
Edit your flight ceiling by typing in the new ceiling in feet into the box.

###Stealth
This hack was produced by Fury.
Normally, you client shares your statistics like position to the server. This hack disables that feature, so when the server does not recieve your position from the client,
it doesn't display you on other peoples nav screens. This hack is FRP, since people will assume you logged off or tped.
