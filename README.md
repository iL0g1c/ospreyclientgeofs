## Disclaimer:
Using the following code to gain an advantage in GeoFS MRP, has been deemed "FRP" by the United Nations of MRP.
I do not condone these actions and this software should be used for expiramental purposes only.

# How to Install
## Userscript manager
1. Install Tampermonkey (Other userscripts managers work as well.)
2. Create a new userscript.
3. Paste in the code from lastest release. Check the releases page in this repository.
4. Say the userscript and enable it.
5. Run GeoFS. The hacks should appear on the screen automatically.

## Chrome Console
1. Open Chrome Dev Console with Ctrl+Shift+J (If this doesn't work, it may be blocked by your organization)
2. Download the latest release and paste it into the console.
3. Press enter.

# Modules
## Flight Module
### Speed Hacks
These currently only work in GeoFS 2.9. This hack works by increasing your aircrafts max RPMs.
The default is 100%, but you can modify your RPMs anywhere from 0 to 100 percent.
You can do this by dragging the slider, or typing in a percentage into the text box.
This hack is FRP seeing that modifing your planes stats is FRP.

### Flight Ceiling
To prevent aircraft from flying to space Xavier added a ZeroThrustAltitude. Once you reach this altitude, you will not be able to produce any thrust.
Edit your flight ceiling by typing in the new ceiling in feet into the box.

### Stealth
This hack was produced by Fury.
Normally, you client shares your statistics like position to the server. This hack disables that feature, so when the server does not recieve your position from the client,
it doesn't display you on other peoples nav screens. This hack is FRP, since people will assume you logged off or tped.

## Combat Module
### Counter Keys Injection
This hack allows you to use key commands to automatically type counters in chat for MRP.
Enable/Disable this by clicking the button.
The key commands for each counter are alt+[fox code].
For example:
alt+1 = chaff
alt+4 = evade
This hack is FRP, as the current UN MRP administration, does not allow semi-automatic countermeasures.

### Countermeasure GUI
This is a clickabble GUI that you can use instead of key commands. I would not recommend this.
Once again, this is FRP.

### Panic Button (Haul Ass)
This hack is a quick button to increase your RPMs to an extreme level. This can theoretically be used to get out of a combat situation quickly.

## Mechanical Module
### InstaGear

As of November 7th 2022, the UN has not issued a statement on this hack. Use with caution.

### InstaFlaps

As of November 7th 2022, the UN has not issued a statement on this hack. Use with caution.

# Known Issues

2. If hacks that modify an aircraft are enabled, you will need reload the page after you switch aircraft.
