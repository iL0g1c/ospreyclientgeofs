# Modules
## Flight Module
### Speed Hacks
The hack allows you to modify your max RPMs of an aircraft.
The default is 100%, but you can modify your RPMs anywhere from 0 to 1000 percent of the default max RPMs.
You can do this by dragging the slider, or typing in a percentage into the text box and pressing enter.
This hack is FRP seeing that modifing your planes stats is FRP.

### Flight Ceiling
To prevent aircraft from flying to space Xavier added a ZeroThrustAltitude. Once you reach this altitude, your engine will not work.
Edit your flight ceiling by typing in the new ceiling in feet into the box.

### Stealth
This hack was developed by Fury.
It hides you from other players map screens, while you are on, and its enabled.
it doesn't display you on other peoples nav screens. This hack is FRP, since people will assume you logged off or tped.

## Combat Module
### Counter Keys Injection
This hack allows you to use key commands to automatically type counters in chat for MRP.
Enable/Disable this by clicking the button.
The key commands for each counter are alt+[fox code].
For example:
alt+1 = chaff
alt+4 = evade
This hack is FRP, as the current UN MRP administration, does not allow semi-automatic countermeasures.
(Yes fox 1 and 3 are repetitive, but it is more intuitive.

### Countermeasure GUI
This is a clickabble GUI that you can use instead of key commands. I would not recommend this.
Once again, this is FRP.

### Panic Button (Haul Ass)
This hack is a quick button to increase your RPMs to an extreme level. This can theoretically be used to get out of a combat situation quickly.
